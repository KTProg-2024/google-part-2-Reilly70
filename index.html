                    The domestic dog is a domesticated form of wolf. The dog descended
                    <br>
                    from an ancient, extinct wolf, with the modern wolf being the dog's
                    <br>
                    nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    the development of agriculture.
